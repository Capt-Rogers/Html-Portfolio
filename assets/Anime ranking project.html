<h1>The Best Animes according to Deepak</h1>
<h2>My Top animes of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    <h3>Deathnote</h3>
    The OG anime for any  anime lover.<br/> The artistic style is somewhat old but the story plotting and characters are on another level.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Erased</h3>
    This anime is about time travel and a mystery in a small town.<br/>  It is of 12 episodes and worth binge watching.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Attack on titan</h3>
    This anime questions about what is it that makes someone bad or good.<br/> It potrays that in this world nothing is bad or good it is just all about survival.
